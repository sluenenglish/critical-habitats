*"Everything starts with one step, or one brick, or one word or one day"*
-- Jeremy Gilley

I restore habitats so that native plants and creatures can find somewhere safe to live.
To achieve this, we need to link as many areas together as possible.
Some of these creatures are very small, so walking a long way is difficult!
Imagine yourself struggling from oasis to oasis in the desert - wouldn't you want more oases?

You can help nature by being a part of the movement to create stepping stones
for biodiversity in your garden.
Each new stepping stone is a vital oasis in the grand scheme of things.
I can provide a full service to build stepping stones for biodiversity not just for you,
but for nature and for the future.

Remember - There is no planet "B"
